"""Cross-platform advisory file locking for Evonic's single-instance guards.

Evonic guards a few singleton resources (the server PID file and the update
lock) with an OS-level advisory lock held for the lifetime of a file
descriptor.  Historically those call sites used ``fcntl.flock`` directly,
which does not exist on Windows and therefore crashed startup there.

This module is a thin, dependency-free abstraction over the platform's native
advisory locking:

* POSIX (Linux/macOS) -> :func:`fcntl.flock` with ``LOCK_EX``.
* Windows             -> :func:`msvcrt.locking` on a one-byte region.

The public API is intentionally tiny:

``open_and_lock(path)``
    Open (creating if needed) and acquire an exclusive, *non-blocking* lock.
    Raises :class:`AlreadyLockedError` when another owner already holds it.

``release(fd)``
    Unlock and close a descriptor previously returned by ``open_and_lock``.

Both platform modules are imported lazily *inside* the helpers so importing
this module never requires ``fcntl`` (absent on Windows) or ``msvcrt`` (absent
on POSIX).
