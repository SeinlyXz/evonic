"""LLM evaluator for active session goals.

After an agent produces a candidate *final* response (no tool calls) while a
session goal is active, the runtime asks this evaluator whether the objective
has actually been met. The verdict gates finalization:

- ``complete``  — the goal is achieved; finalize and clear the goal indicator.
- ``continue``  — progress was made but the objective is not met yet; the
  runtime nudges the agent to keep working (bounded by ``max_goal_nudges``).
- ``blocked``   — the agent cannot proceed without user input; finalize and
  clear so the user can respond.

The evaluator always *fails open*: any transport/parse failure returns
``complete`` with ``failed=True`` so a transient outage can never trap the
agent in a continuation loop.
